Petals to the Metal - Flower Classification on TPU
Overview
Petals to the Metal is a flower classification project that leverages Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for accelerated model training. This project focuses on accurately classifying flower species based on images of their petals. The use of TPUs enhances the training speed and efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale datasets.

Installation
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have a TPU-enabled environment set up.

Usage
To use the trained model for flower classification, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/petals-to-the-metal.git
cd petals-to-the-metal
Run the inference script:
bash
Copy code
python infer.py --image_path /path/to/flower_image.jpg
Replace /path/to/flower_image.jpg with the path to the image you want to classify.

Model Training
If you want to train the model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset in the required format. Refer to the Dataset section for details.

Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
Replace /path/to/dataset with the path to your prepared dataset.

Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation script:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model
Replace /path/to/saved_model with the path to the trained model.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tpu-getting-started.
